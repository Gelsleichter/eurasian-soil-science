# Eurasian Soil Science Citation Style

This repository contains the [Citation Style Language (CSL)](https://citationstyles.org/) file for the [Eurasian Soil Science](https://link.springer.com/journal/11475) journal. The CSL file was derived from [Transactions of the Materials Research Society of Japan](http://www.zotero.org/styles/transactions-of-the-materials-research-society-of-japan) using the [Zotero CSL Editor](https://www.zotero.org/styles).

## Usage

### Reference Managers
The CSL file can be loaded into reference management tools such as [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) or other compatible software. Once loaded, it allows you to format citations and bibliographies according to the Eurasian Soil Science journal's style directly in your text editors.

### LaTeX with LuaLaTeX
You can also use this CSL style in LaTeX projects when compiling with LuaLaTeX. For more details and examples on how to integrate CSL styles in LaTeX, check out the following resources:
